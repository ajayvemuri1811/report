##### ABSTRACT




    Covid Pandemic has affected every area known to humans, Some fields coped with the pandemic smoothly while others were hit hard and knew that they had to course correct their trajectory for being able to move forward. The Indian education system was one of them..

    Covid showed us the real gaps in the Indian education system with the whole system switching to online mode of education. Those schools, colleges which had the infrastructure already in place faced little to no problem but a large number of them had to adjust. This project gives a take on how we bring more institutions on the digital infrastructure using cloud and hence reap benefits of economy of scale.
 














##### Purpose of This Study

    This study attempts to create a cloud based platform to store, allocate and view scores of students in user friendly, efficient and cheap manner. 












##### Problem Definition

	In this project we will be attempting to create a portal for an institution for allocating, storing and viewing scores of all students in their respective courses. We will be attempting to  create the portal using cloud services provided by Google Cloud Services through firebase. The reason to do it with cloud is to reduce the costs which have to be paid by institutions to create and manage such an infrastructure.


##### Objectives

    Our main objective is to create the portal with minimum cost and have minimal managing costs associated with it due to the economy of scale provided by cloud platforms. They can be further divided into the following points:

- Create a user friendly portal
- Have minimum operating costs
- Achieve minimal developing costs
- Prove that a cloud can be a viable way to provide digital infrastructure to students.
- Data is secure and can be used for future tasks







##### Economic Feasibility
Due to inherent advantages of a large scale cloud platform like [Google Cloud Platform (GCP)](https://cloud.google.com/) the economic cost of developing a web based platform can be reduced a lot. As much as that, the cost of development can be reduced to only the time of developers developing the platform.

##### Technical Feasibility
The technical aspect of the project has been taken care of by the apis provided by [FireBase](https://firebase.google.com/) platform. They provide APIs for accessing the database in the cloud as well as hosting services for the website. We will be using github pages to host our project because it provides easier access to the source code.

##### Operational Feasibility
One of the major goals of the project is to minimise the operational cost of the platform. The platform can be hosted on github free of cost and the cost of using databases will increase with increase in the user base. That too will be minimal as compared to hosting the platform with its own servers.














The proposed scheme is to create a website to act as a platform for all the academic members of the institution to communicate regarding their academic performances in a clear and transparent manner as well as digitally storing the marks of the student in a readable and future proof way.

 The website will be hosted on [github pages](https://pages.github.com/) which provides a free hosting platform to all websites. The back end of the project will be handled by Firebase platform which is a subsidiary of Google Cloud Platform. We  will use the NoSQL database of the platform in order to store the marks and data of students. The reason for using NoSQL  database is that these types of databases use horizontal scalability rather than vertical scalability. As a result they can handle large amounts of data easily.


Teachers of the institution will be able to update scores of students and students will be able to view their score in orderly  fashion. Admins of the system will be able to give and provide various privileges to teachers and students and maintain the platform as well.

We will try to make this project as modular as possible so that any institution can add or remove features as they desire with little effort. This will immensely increase the scope of improvement and innovation in the project.
